# Description

GPCS (General Purpose Chat System) API is an AI powered chat system that allows users to interact with a chatbot. The chatbot is capable of answering questions, providing information, and making recommendations. The chatbot is powered by Google's Generative AI model ( Gemini-pro )

This API is built with cloud driven approach in mind, it uses AWS S3 for storing files, AWS Polly for text-to-speech, GCP Vertex AI ( Multimodal text, image, audio, video, PDF, code, and chat ) for chatbot, GCP Speech API for speech-to-text, Stripe and Razorpay for payment processing and websockets for real-time chat communication ( Between users and chatbot only )

# Features

-   User authentication
-   AI powered chatbot
-   Voice interaction with the chatbot
-   Hybrid payment system (Stripe and Razorpay)
-   Real-time chat through websockets

# Deployment Diagram

This diagram illustrates the deployment architecture of the GPCS API. The API deployment architecture is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant and most importantly secure infrastructure. 

To achieve this, I preferred to use AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) with Fargate launch type. This allows me to run the API in a containerized environment without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

The reason of choosing ECS over EC2 is because ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that allows me to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. It also provides features like auto-scaling, load balancing, and monitoring.

All this advantages comes with relatively less efforts to manage and worry about infra and security which helps me to be more productive.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinitparekh17/gpcs
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory as per the `.env.example` file

4. Start the server

```bash
yarn server-dev # For development

yarn build && yarn start # For production
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to have MongoDB running on your local machine or provide the connection string in the `.env` file <br/> <br/>
> Also, make sure to have the required AWS, GCP, Stripe and Razorpay credentials in the `.env` file
> which are required for the API to work properly.
